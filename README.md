# MNIST Streamlit

This is a simple Streamlit app that demonstrates the differences between neural nets trained on the same dataset (MNIST dataset).

There are two models created and saved locally available in the `models` directory:

- `mnist_model.keras`
- `autokeras_model.keras`

The `mnist_model.keras` is a simple 300x300 neural net while `autokeras_model.keras` is a more complex model generated by running the [Autokeras image classifier class](https://autokeras.com/image_classifier/). As these models are stored and versioned on XetHub, you can see their architecture by visiting the file in the repository (mnist_model and autokeras_model).

The application allows you to:

1. Select which model you want to use for predicting a handwritten digit
2. Select your stroke width of the digit you draw
3. Draw a specific digit within a canvas

Once you draw a digit, the model will be loaded, asked to make a prediction on your input, and provide:

- A prediction (the top prediction from it's probability distribution)
- The time it took to predict
- The name of the model used to make the prediction
- The probability distribution of predictions as a bar chart and table

## Usage

To run the Streamlit app locally, clone the repository, `cd` into the created directory, and run the following commands:

- `poetry shell`
- `poetry install`
- `streamlit run app.py`

You can also re-train the model by modifying the net in `src/training.py` and re-running the training by running `python training.py` (which will save the new model in `/models`). This will overwrite the existing model and will be used in subsequent runs of the Streamlit app.
